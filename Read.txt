1) The folder data has 2 folders(pic and pic_aligned)

2) The folder pic_aligned has the aligned pictures from pic

3) dataset_preparation.py, face_embeddings.py and face_Alignment.py are helper functions and are being used in disparity.py

4) Face alignment and noise removal is done as part of the alignment and extraction process. Might need to check for any other 
noise removal validations.

5) To run:
	Disparity.py which will calculate the disparity scores for 2 pictures depending on what we pass as arguments.
	The disparity right now is based on cosine. Euclidean distance is also being computed. 

6) If running the script directly, need to install libraries and change corresponding directory paths inside the helper functions and main module.
